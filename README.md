# HeroesManager

Welcome! This is currently a library to extract and rebuild the *Data.jmp* file from the game "300 Heroes"

# How to Extract

to extract files just follow the cmd instructions (input and output)

# How to Build

to build it, you have to type *build* instead of the Data.jmp path and then you have to enter the data path which should be the same as the output path you entered when extracting
